# altium-to-circuit-json

Convert Altium schematic and PCB documents into [Circuit JSON](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json).

The converter is built on [altiumts](https://github.com/tscircuit/altiumts). Its visual tests render the original document with `altiumts` on the left and the converted Circuit JSON with `circuit-to-svg` on the right, then combine the panels with `stack-svgs` and verify them with `bun-match-svg`.

## Install

```sh
bun add altium-to-circuit-json
```

## Usage

Automatic format detection accepts text, `Uint8Array`, or `ArrayBuffer` input:

```ts
import { readFile } from "node:fs/promises"
import { convertAltiumToCircuitJson } from "altium-to-circuit-json"

const bytes = await readFile("motor-controller.PcbDoc")
const circuitJson = convertAltiumToCircuitJson(bytes)
```

Parsed `altiumts` documents can be converted directly:

```ts
import { parseAltiumSchDoc } from "altiumts"
import { convertAltiumSchDocToCircuitJson } from "altium-to-circuit-json"

const document = parseAltiumSchDoc(schematicBytes)
const circuitJson = convertAltiumSchDocToCircuitJson(document)
```

The public conversion functions are:

- `convertAltiumToCircuitJson(source, options)` for automatic parsing and conversion.
- `convertAltiumDocumentToCircuitJson(document, options)` for an already parsed document.
- `convertAltiumPcbDocToCircuitJson(document, options)` for PCB documents.
- `convertAltiumSchDocToCircuitJson(document, options)` for schematic documents.

For callers that need progress visibility, debugging, or custom orchestration,
the same conversion is exposed as a staged converter:

```ts
import { AltiumToCircuitJsonConverter } from "altium-to-circuit-json"

const converter = new AltiumToCircuitJsonConverter(bytes)
while (!converter.finished) {
  console.log(converter.currentStage?.constructor.name)
  converter.step()
}
const circuitJson = converter.getOutput()
```

Each stage has the standard converter contract: `step()`,
`runUntilFinished()`, `finished`, and `getOutput()`. The parser boundary stays
in `altiumts`; conversion stages consume typed Altium documents and records.

## Current coverage

PCB conversion currently emits:

- polygon board outlines and board cutouts;
- PCB component placement bounds;
- top, bottom, and inner-layer copper tracks;
- vias;
- circular, rectangular, rounded, octagonal, rotated, pill, slotted, plated, and non-plated pads/holes;
- top and bottom silkscreen lines, arcs, fills, and text; and
- Altium mil coordinates converted to millimeters.

Copper layers follow the board's physical stack order, including interleaved
signal and plane layers. Layer IDs and custom stack names resolve to the same
Circuit JSON layer. The current schema supports up to ten copper layers
(`top`, `inner1`–`inner8`, `bottom`). Conversion throws for larger or ambiguous
stacks and for copper layers absent from the stack. Documents without stack
information support outer-layer copper only.

Schematic conversion currently emits:

- a Circuit JSON `schematic_sheet`, with imported geometry page-fitted and
  centered inside its standard A4 drawing area;
- typed source components, source ports, source nets, and source traces;
- standard Circuit JSON resistor, capacitor, inductor, diode, LED, test-point,
  power, and ground symbols;
- box-with-pins schematic components with named and numbered schematic ports
  for chips, connectors, and other multi-pin parts;
- wires as schematic traces, including mid-segment labels, pin terminals,
  T-junctions, and explicit junctions;
- polylines, polygons, rectangles, circles, ellipses, and arcs;
- no-ERC markers, hierarchical ports, and power ports;
- labels, net labels, designators, parameters, and text frames; and
- active multipart/display-mode filtering, with multiple placed symbol parts
  sharing one physical source component.

By default, schematic coordinates are scaled from the Altium page dimensions
and centered on the emitted `schematic_sheet`. Set `schematicUnitScale` to use
an explicit coordinate scale, or `centerOnSchematicSheet: false` to preserve an
Altium-style origin. The old plain rectangular page outline remains available
as an opt-in compatibility overlay with `includeSheetBorder: true`.

The package is intentionally an incremental converter. Complete component
classification, copper pours/regions, mechanical/dimension primitives, models,
and project-level hierarchy remain follow-up areas.

## Visual tests

Download the checksum-pinned upstream reference files and run the tests:

```sh
bun run test
```

Update the SVG snapshots after an intentional visual change:

```sh
bun run test:update-svg
```

Every imported reference used by the test suite has a side-by-side SVG snapshot. The committed fixtures are generated from pinned upstream URLs and are not stored in this repository.

The real-world PCB corpus covers NodeMCU ESP-12, EBAZ4205, HERON Payload SSM,
SimpleFOC Mini, and SimpleFOC Shield V3. The schematic corpus covers NodeMCU,
HERON PAY-SSM and Systems PCB, SimpleFOC Mini, and SimpleFOC Shield V3.

The TI power-reference PCB corpus covers PMP23595, the PMP23653 main and planar
transformer boards, and the PMP22650 package's PMP22650, PMP22712, and PMP22773
boards. Each is downloaded directly from its checksum-pinned TI CAD/CAE archive
and has an Altium-to-Circuit-JSON side-by-side SVG repro.

The TI SPRCAL9 / TMDS62LEVM Rev. B regression corpus includes all 57
schematic sheets and a top-copper PCB comparison. Its large downloaded source
files are checksum-verified and cached in CI. To also write the complete
converted Circuit JSON artifacts locally, run:

```sh
bun run convert:ti-reference
```

This creates `artifacts/ti-tmds62levm-rev-b/pcb.circuit.json`, one Circuit JSON
file per schematic sheet, and a conversion manifest. The artifact directory is
gitignored; the compact SVG regression snapshots remain committed.

## Development

```sh
bun install
bun run typecheck
bun run format:check
bun run build
```
